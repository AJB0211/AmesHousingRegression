# Regression Models on the Ames Housing Data Set
Authors: Alex Bruening and Ryan Willett
Date of final publication: June 3rd, 2019

This repo is for the classic Kaggle competition concerning prediction of the sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. 
Documents present in the repo are limited to exploratory Jupyter notebooks, the data work-up demonstrating pipeline usage, and an example script that demonstrates the workflow for using the aforementioned documents.
